This project lets us browse the IMDB dataset downloaded here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/ and inserted after into a SQL database.

The 'load_data' file consists the insert query with which you can load table by table into your SQL database.

You can search by title, genre, type (movie, documentary, videogame, TV Show, etc), keyword or rate.
You can also search by the name of the member of the crew.
And there is a part of the search dedicated to TVshows only.
